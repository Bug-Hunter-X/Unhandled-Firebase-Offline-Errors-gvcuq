This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase:  unhandled offline errors. The `offlineBug.js` file contains code that attempts to write data to the Realtime Database without checking the network connection status. This results in an error when the client is offline.  The `offlineBugSolution.js` shows how to correctly handle offline events using Firebase's offline capabilities.  Proper error handling is essential to ensure a smooth user experience, even when offline.
